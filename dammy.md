# Introduction

Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.

My name is Haruka Nakazawa, and I’m a freelance editor and writer based in Tokyo.
I mainly work with print and online media, creating content and developing editorial concepts.
I’m especially passionate about “drawing out people’s voices,” and I specialize in shaping interviews and conversations to bring out what makes someone truly unique.

# Background

Before becoming independent, I spent five years working at a publishing company as a book editor.
There, I worked on a wide range of publications, including business books, essays, and lifestyle titles.

Now as a freelancer, my work extends beyond writing and editing to include PR support for companies and non-profits, event planning, and independent zine production.
Across all these projects, my focus is on the art of communication and curation—how to tell stories in meaningful, engaging ways.

# Interests & Values

I studied cultural anthropology at university, which deepened my interest in how people live, what they care about, and the values they hold.

I try not to be confined by job titles, and I truly enjoy meeting people from different backgrounds and perspectives.
I believe that meaningful conversations often start from the simplest of encounters.

# Hobbies & Favorites

- Taking long walks through the city
- Discovering cozy, independent coffee shops
- Exploring ceramics and experimenting with radio production

Also, I’m a big fan of **anything chocorate-flavored**, and I can never resist a warm slice of **freshly baked sourdough bread**.

# Closing

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.
If our paths ever cross, I’d love to have a conversation with you.
Feel free to reach out anytime—it would be a pleasure to connect.
